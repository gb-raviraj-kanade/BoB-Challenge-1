Draft a SMS and Email body alerting the user in case of Payment Due Dates (ONLY IF CUSTOMER HAS INSUFFICIENT FUNDS or LOW BALANCE) or any Anomalies. Clearly alert low balance as "You have an upcoming Payment of X on 'date' and your current balance is Y. Please ensure you have sufficient funds to make this payment on 'date'.". \
