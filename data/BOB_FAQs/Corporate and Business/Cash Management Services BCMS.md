*   What is BCMS?
    
    Baroda Cash Management Services (BCMS) is a software application that facilitates the management of customer funds, particularly, of corporate customers. Generally, corporate customers with large volumes of transactions are the target group for BCMS. It is a common practice in the industry that corporate customers, particularly, those who have either their own offices spread out across the country or those having suppliers/customers spread throughout the country, look to banks for their fund management activities. The main principle here is that corporates like to outsource their non-core activities to enable them to focus on their core business. BCMS is a product that aptly fits into such customer requirements and the system is prevalent in the banking industry for over a decade.
