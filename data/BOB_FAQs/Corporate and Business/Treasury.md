*   Options
    
    *   An Option offers the buyer/holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified amount of the underlying asset at an agreed rate on or before a specified future date. This arrangement, by natural extension, puts the obligation, not the right, to buy or sell the underlying asset at the pre-determined price at a specified future date. For the right to exercise the option, the buyer pays the seller/writer a premium, which is called the option price.
    *   Option may either be a Call Option or a put option. Under the Call Option, the buyer has the right to buy the underlying asset whereas, under the Put Option the buyer enjoys the right to sell the underlying asset.
    *   Among the various types of Options are the Interest Rate Options (Bonds Option, caps, Floors, Collars etc.) and Currency Options. Interest Rate Option offers the buyer the right, not the obligation, to fix at a point of time in the future, either the interest rate on a notional deposit or loan or the price of an instrument. With such instruments, buyer is protected against an adverse interest rate movement while retaining the ability to benefit from a favourable movement. A Currency Option gives the buyer the right, not the obligation, to exchange two currencies at a fixed rate at a future point of time. Under this type of Option buyer's downside risk is eliminated while retaining the unlimited upside potential.
