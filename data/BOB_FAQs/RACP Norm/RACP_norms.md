    Example: If due date of a loan account is March 31, 2022, and full dues are not received before the lending institution runs the day-end process for this date, the date of overdue shall be March 31, 2022 and the account will be classified as SMA0 as on 31.03.2022. If it continues to remain overdue, then this account shall get tagged as SMA-1 upon running day-end process on April 30, 2022 i.e. upon completion of 30 days of being continuously overdue. Accordingly, the date of SMA-1 classification for that account shall be April 30, 2022.
    
    Similarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, it shall get tagged as SMA-2 upon running day-end process on May 30, 2022 and if continues to remain overdue further, it shall get classified as NPA upon running day-end process on June 29, 2022.
    
    *   In respect of accounts in the nature of revolving facilities like cash credit / overdraft the account turns into an NPA when:
    
    the outstanding balance in the CC / OD account remains continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit/drawing power for• 90 days, or, ii) the outstanding balance in the CC / OD account is less than the sanctioned limit/drawing power but there are no credits continuously for 90 days, or the outstanding balance in the CC I OD account is less than the sanctioned limit/drawing power but credits are not enough to cover the interest debited during the 'previous 90 days period'.

    *   Renewal Pending:
    
    Regular and ad hoc credit limits need to be reviewed / regularized not later than three months from the due date / date of ad hoc sanction. In case of constraints such as non-availability of financial statements and other data from the borrowers, the branch should
    
    furnish evidence to show that renewal I review of credit limits is already on and would be completed soon. In any case, delay beyond six months is not considered desirable as a general discipline. Hence, an account where the regular/ ad hoc credit limits have not been reviewed I renewed within 180 days from the due date / date of ad hoc sanction will be treated as NPA.
    
    If the due date for renewal is 31-03-2022 and if the limit is not renewed till 26th Sep 2022, such account will be classified as NPA during Day end Process run on 26-09-2022.
