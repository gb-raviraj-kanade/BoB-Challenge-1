*   The increase in tenor resulted in increase in amount that I will be paying back to the Bank on my loan which seems to be more in comparison to Moratorium interest. How is the increase in EMI tenor calculated?
    
    The accrued interest have been added to balance outstanding. Hence the additional amount is the accrued interest on the unpaid EMI which you have to pay at the end of the loan tenor. However if you have adequate funds to pay the deferred EMI/Instalments/Interest during the moratorium period, you can pay to avoid any extra interest burden.
