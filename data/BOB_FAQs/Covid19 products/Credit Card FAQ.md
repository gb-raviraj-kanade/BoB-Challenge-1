*   The Moratorium is summarised below:
    
    *   As advised by the RBI, the Moratorium, first granted for payments falling due between 1st March 2020 and 31st May 2020 has now been extended to payments falling due till 31st August 2020
    *   The Moratorium is applicable for your BoB Credit Card dues as indicated in the statements dated 1st June 2020, 1st July 2020 and 1st August 2020
    *   You are eligible for the Moratorium if your statement dated 1st March 2020 did NOT mention “IMMEDIATE” under the “Payment Due Date” column.
    *   If your 1st March 2020 statement mentioned “IMMEDIATE” under Payment Due Date, please make the payment as advised on the statement or on call from our representatives, to make your BoB credit card account regular. Once your card account is regular and your statements of 1st June, 1st July and 1st August do not mention “IMMEDIATE”, you will be eligible for the remaining Moratorium period.
    *   If you are eligible for the Moratorium, you may choose not to make any payment towards the dues indicated in the 1st June, 1st July and 1st August statements. No Late Payment Charges will be levied as part of the Moratorium. Your card account will continue to be regular and will not be reported as overdue/delinquent during the Moratorium period.
    *   However, as advised by the RBI, interest will continue to occur on the unpaid balance and fresh transactions, unless you pay the Total Payment Due. We recommend you continue to make payments to avoid/reduce accrual of interest.
    *   Please note that any payments already made towards your 1st June statement dues will not be refunded.
    *   If you have opted for Auto Debit, we will debit your BoB savings account towards the payments due in the 1st June, 1st July and 1st August statements. If you do not want us to debit your BoB savings account during the Moratorium extension, please respond to the SMS and E-mail you’ll receive from us shortly.
    *   As per current guidelines, the Moratorium will end on 31st August 2020. Hence, the statement dated 1st September 2020 will require you to pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date, to avoid levy of Late Payment Charges and your credit card becoming overdue/delinquent. The statement will also have the interest accrued during the Moratorium period, and will be part of payment due.
    *   For more questions about the Moratorium, please visit our website (www.bobfinancial.com) and check the FAQ. You can also check the Most Important Terms & Conditions to understand how interest is charged on the unpaid balances and fresh transactions, if you don’t pay the Total Payment Due.
