    NSDL is allowing waiver of charges to DPs where all the securities in an account are moved to another account with another DP due to account closure, if account name remains the same. NSDL allows waiver of its charges for cases where NSDL charges to the DP are more than Rs. 100. Your DP may pass on this benefit to you.
