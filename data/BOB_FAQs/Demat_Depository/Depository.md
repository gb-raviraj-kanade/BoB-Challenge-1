*   How can one avail the service of a depository?
    
    A depository interface with the investors through its agents called Depository Participants (DPs). If an investor wants to avail the services offered by the depository, the investor has to open an account with a DP. This is similar to opening an account with any branch of a bank in order to utilise the bank's services.
    
    Our Bank has now centralised DP operations (both for CDSL as well as NSDL) besides existing DPs, which are being planned to be migrated to central set-up in a phased manner. The central back-office DP Operations (CBODPO) is at UTI Tower, Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai.
