*   How will I know that my DP has updated my account after each transaction?
    
    Your DP will give you a transaction statement periodically, which will detail your current balances and the various transactions you have done through the depository account. If you so desire, your DP may provide the transaction statement at intervals shorter than the stipulated ones, probably at a cost. A format of statement of transactions is reproduced as Annexure.

*   What is to be done if there are any discrepancies in my transaction statement?
    
    In case of any discrepancy in the transaction statement, you can contact your DP. If the discrepancy cannot be resolved at the DP level, you should approach NSDL.
    
    NSDL also sends out a statement of holdings to a few clients of DPs, picked at random. In case the balance in your account as indicated by your DP does not tally with the balance as indicated by NSDL, you can contact your DP/ NSDL for clarification.
