*   What is meant by dematerialisation?
    
    *   Dematerialisation is the process by which physical certificates of an investor are converted to an equivalent number of securities in electronic form and credited in the investor's account with his DP.
    *   In order to dematerialise certificates, an investor will have to first open an account with a branch DP and then request for the dematerialisation of certificates by filling up a dematerialisation request form (DRF), which is available with branch DP and submitting the same along with the physical certificates.
    *   The investor has to ensure that before the certificates are handed over to the branch DP for demat, they are defaced by marking "Surrendered for Dematerialisation" on the face of the certificates. (PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS DEFACING IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE DONE BY THE CLIENT IN CASE DEMAT ACCOUNT IS OPENED WITH CDSL DP. The defacing is the responsibility of the branch DP in case of CDSL demat account)

*   How can an investor/demat account holder purchase dematerialised securities?
    
    *   For receiving demat securities, the demat account holder may give a one-time standing instruction to his/her branch DP. This standing instruction can be given at the time of account opening or later. He/she may also choose to give separate receipt instructions every time some securities are to be received. However, it is advisable to give standing instructions for "credits" at the time of opening demat account.
    *   The transactions relating to the purchase of securities are summarised below:
    *   Demat account holder purchases securities through a broker;
    *   He/she makes payment to his/her broker who arranges payment to clearing corporation on the pay-in day;
    *   His/her broker receives a credit of securities in clearing account on the pay-out day;
    *   His/her broker gives instructions to branch DP to debit clearing account and credit his/her account;
    *   He/she receives shares into his/her demat account. However, if standing instructions are not given at the time of opening the account, he/she will have to give 'Receipt Instructions' to his/her branch DP for receiving credit,
    *   He/she should ensure that his/her broker transfers the securities purchased from his (broker's) clearing account to his/her (client's) depository account, before the book closure. If the securities remain in the clearing account of the broker, the company may give corporate benefits to the broker. In that case, he/she will have to collect benefits from his/her broker.
