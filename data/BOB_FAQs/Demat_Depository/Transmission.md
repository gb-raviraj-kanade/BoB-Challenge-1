*   What does transmission mean in relation to demat accounts?
    
    Transmission is the process by which securities of a deceased account holder are transferred to the account of the legal heirs/nominee of the deceased account holder. Process of transmission in case of dematerialised holdings is more convenient as the transmission formalities for all securities held in a demat account. It can be completed by submitting documents to your DP whereas in case of physical securities the legal heirs/nominee/surviving joint holder has to correspond with all the companies in which shares are held independently.
