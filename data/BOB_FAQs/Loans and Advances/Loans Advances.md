*   How the advance is required to be repaid?

    For advances to acquire fixed assets, the repayment is agreed as per the repayment capacity reckoned with the expected cash flow from the business operations, and, therefore, it can be either equal or ballooning monthly/quarterly/half-yearly/yearly instalments or a bullet payment along with the timely servicing of interest as per the agreed terms.
